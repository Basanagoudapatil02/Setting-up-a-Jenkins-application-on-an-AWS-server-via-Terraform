Instead of manually accessing the console to find the instance’s IP address, you can configure Terraform to automatically output the IP address in a clickable link format, making it easy to access via a web browser.

1.	Navigate to your project directory containing the resource, variable, and provider configuration files.

2.	Create a new file named outputs.tf.

3.	Copy the contents of the [outputs.tf](https://github.com/Basanagoudapatil02/Setting-up-a-Jenkins-application-on-an-AWS-server-via-Terraform/blob/main/Application%20Infrastructure/output.tf) file from the repository and paste them into your newly created file.

This setup enables Terraform to display the instance’s IP address as an output after deployment, simplifying access to jenkins.
