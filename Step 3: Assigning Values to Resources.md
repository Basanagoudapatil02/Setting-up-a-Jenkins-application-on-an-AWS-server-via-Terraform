1. In the previous step, resource configuration files were created without assigning specific values. Since values are essential for resource creation, this step focuses on providing those values.
2. Create a terraform.tfvars file to assign values to the variables declared in variables.tf. This keeps your configuration flexible and avoids hardcoding values.
3. To follow best security and configuration practices, assign the actual values to these variables in the [terraform.tfvars](https://github.com/Basanagoudapatil02/Setting-up-a-Jenkins-application-on-an-AWS-server-via-Terraform/blob/main/Application%20Infrastructure/terraform.tfvars) file. This separation of variable definitions and their values promotes better security, flexibility, and maintainability in your Terraform configurations.
